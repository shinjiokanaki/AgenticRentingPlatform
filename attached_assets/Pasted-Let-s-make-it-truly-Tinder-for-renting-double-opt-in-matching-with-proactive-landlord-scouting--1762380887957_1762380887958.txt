Let’s make it truly “Tinder for renting” — double-opt-in matching with proactive landlord scouting, not just tenant search. Search stays primary for tenants, but landlords get a Scout Mode to discover, shortlist, and invite qualified tenants into a booking flow.

Here’s a concrete blueprint you can build on Next.js + Clerk + Convex + Stripe.

Product shape
Tenant side (familiar, search-first)

Search modal → results with Likely/Maybe/Unlikely badges + short reasons.

Tenant Passport (visibility controls): salary band, move-in window, household size, pets, documents status (ID/payslips/address). Toggle what’s discoverable by landlords.

Swipe Deck (optional): “Daily Picks” (top 20 properties) → swipe right to shortlist, left to pass. This drives strong engagement signals.

Landlord side — Scout Mode (proactive sourcing)

Tenant Pool: ranked list of nearby tenants who match the property (or saved criteria). Cards show:

Match score + reasons (“Income multiple met; Move-in aligns; Docs 80% complete”)

Soft signals: reply rate, verified ID badge, doc completeness ring.

Swipe/Shortlist: swipe right to invite; left to pass; super-like = auto-invite with message template.

Invite to View / Pre-Approve:

“Invite to viewing” → tenant sees a card + available slots.

“Pre-approve subject to checks” → boosts acceptance and reduces viewing churn.

Auto-Scout rules (agents under the hood):

“Whenever a tenant ≥80 score within 3 miles appears, send an invite to 10am Saturday slot.”

“If price reduced by >5%, re-invite last week’s 60–74 score tenants.”

Double-opt-in matching

A match happens only when both sides indicate interest (tenant shortlists property and landlord shortlists tenant or sends invite accepted by tenant).

On match, open a thread with three actions: Book Viewing, Ask a Question, Share Docs (scoped).

Ranking & matching (both directions)

Tenant→Property (existing):

scoreTP = 40*affordability + 20*reqFit + 15*timingFit + 15*docs + 10*rentFit


Property→Tenant (for Scout Mode):

scorePT = 35*affordability_to_rent   // salary vs rent * incomeMultiple
        + 20*timing_overlap          // move-in vs availableFrom
        + 15*doc_completeness        // % of landlord-required docs present
        + 15*engagement              // tenant reply rate / recency
        + 10*household_fit           // pets/students/HMO rules
        + 5 *distance_decay


Labels: Hot (≥80), Warm (65–79), Cold (<65).
Always show “See all” to avoid hidden inventory.

Agents (behind the scenes)

Scout Agent (landlord):

Runs on property publish/price change & hourly cron.

Builds PT candidate set, updates rank list, sends batched invites under rate limits.

Explainer Agent:

Generates one-line “why this tenant/property” for cards + full reasons on detail.

Availability Agent:

Nudges both sides to pick a slot; resolves clashes; generates ICS; sends reminders.

Docs Agent:

When invited, requests only missing docs; handles redaction & time-boxed sharing.

Price Optimizer (optional):

Suggests rent adjustments based on engagement deltas (views→invites→viewings).

Anti-spam, fairness, and safety (UK-aware, non-legal)

Rate limits: max X invites/day/property; progressive caps for new landlords.

Eligibility first: no invites if tenant fails hard rules (Right-to-Rent responsibility messaging, pets disallowed, etc.).

Fairness guardrails: no targeting on protected characteristics; ranking uses objective tenancy signals (income, timing, docs, engagement). Provide audit logs and appeal path.

Masked contact until viewing booked; payments on-platform only.

Data model (Convex deltas)
// Swipe & interest
tenantPropertyLikes: { tenantId, propertyId, kind: 'like'|'pass'|'superlike', createdAt }
landlordTenantLikes: { landlordId, tenantId, propertyId?, kind: 'invite'|'pass'|'superlike', createdAt }

// Visibility & preferences
tenantPassport: {
  tenantId, visible: boolean,
  shareFields: { salaryBand: boolean, moveIn: boolean, pets: boolean, docsStatus: boolean }
}

// Saved searches / auto-scout rules
scoutRules: {
  landlordId, propertyId?, // tie to a specific listing or general criteria
  criteria: { geo, rentMin, rentMax, beds, moveInFrom, moveInTo, pets, students },
  minScore: number, dailyCap: number, active: boolean
}

// Matches (double opt-in)
matches: {
  tenantId, landlordId, propertyId,
  origin: 'tenant_like'|'landlord_invite'|'both',
  status: 'pending'|'matched'|'stale',
  createdAt, lastActionAt
}

Key flows (API contracts)
// POST /api/landlord/scout
// body: { propertyId, cursor?, limit? }
// returns: [{ tenantId, scorePT, label, reasons, previewFields }]

// POST /api/landlord/invite
// body: { propertyId, tenantId, messageTemplateId?, slotId? }
// creates landlordTenantLikes(kind='invite'), notifies tenant

// POST /api/tenant/respond-invite
// body: { inviteId, action: 'accept'|'decline' }
// on accept: create match + open thread

// POST /api/swipe
// body: { side: 'tenant'|'landlord', targetType: 'property'|'tenant', targetId, kind: 'like'|'pass'|'superlike' }

UI components you’ll need

SwipeDeck (both sides): stack of cards with right/left/superlike.

TenantPool (landlord): list + deck toggle; filters up top; infinite scroll.

InviteSheet: quick templates (“Hey {{firstName}}, you look like a great fit for 2-bed in SE1. We have slots Sat 10–12.”).

MatchDialog: double-opt-in success, with actions: Book Viewing / Ask / Share Docs.

AutoScoutRuleBuilder: create/edit rule; preview expected weekly invites.

PassportSettings: tenant visibility toggles + “Improve your match score” checklist.

Ops & metrics (to keep it healthy)

Liquidity quality: invites sent → accepted → viewing booked.

Match symmetry: % matches from tenant-led vs landlord-led.

Time to viewing and no-show rate.

Doc completeness before viewing.

Abuse signals: invite decline reasons, landlord invite cap hit %, block rates.
